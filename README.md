# Angular Tastypie Service

## Why use this service?
Django Tastypie is a very amazing Django app for building RESTful API resources. AngularJS is the reason why we should love JavaScript.

Using Django Tastypie in backend and AngularJS in frontend is very good collaboration. This AngularJS service serves as a "gate" to both.

## Instruction
I suppose you have basic understanding of the following,

- [Django Framework](https://docs.djangoproject.com/)
- [Django Tastypie](http://django-tastypie.readthedocs.org/en/latest/interacting.html)
- [AngularJS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9MHigUZKEM)

I know, even when I try my best to make this service more useful, there are still bugs here and there.

You can help me improving this service by forking this repository, reporting bugs, or even buying me some books ;-)
